## DynamicImport
Problem: I want to have a dynamic import of **constantsMac.js** and **constantsWin.js** For test purposes, use the global variable GLOBAL_OS in main.js

To run code:
```sh
npm run start
```

## HACKERMAN
Made script **platformManager.sh**
it renames all files with the string **constantsWin** and replaces it with **constantsMac**
Now I need to find out how to do it on windows
